# How-do-you-Java
Fundamentals of Javascript Quiz
## Description

The goal for this project was to design a timed multiple-choice quiz that allows the user to save their top scores. 
The challenge was for the quiz to run in the browser, have a nice polished look, and engage the user with the timer point system.  
The coding quiz app has a responsive user interface and is built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Learning to create the app in a manner where the user's scores are stored and displayed upon request was a large part of this project.
